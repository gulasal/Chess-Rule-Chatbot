chess is a two-player abstract strategy board game -
the object or objective of the game is to checkmate the opponent’s king -
the King’s safety and positioning are paramount -
the King can only move one square at a time in any direction, it must be protected at all costs.

There are 32 pieces in total -
each player controls 16 pieces of six types on a chessboard king, queen, bishop, knight, castle, pawn -
each type of piece moves in a distinct way -
a game can end in various ways, checkmate, resignation or a draw.

capturing means taking a piece that is in a threatened position -
a threatened piece is one that is at risk of being captured -
a piece can be taken if it is at the end of path of an opponent's piece -
for the bishop, castle and queen, it just has to be in the way, but the capturing piece has to stop as soon it has captured the threatened piece.

castling is moving the king two squares towards a rook on the same rank and then moving the rook to the square that the king passed over -
there are conditions neither the king nor the rook has previously moved -
the squares between the king and the rook are vacant, the king does not leave, cross over, or finish on a square attacked by an enemy piece -
there aren't any pieces between the king and the rook taking part in the castling move -
the recommendation it is a good idea when it can get your king out of the center of the board into a safer position -
it helps to bring one of your rooks towards the center of the board where it can be more active.

en-passant is capturing a pawn which skipped a threatened position on the first move by skipping two steps -
en passant can only be carried out by a pawn on another pawn
when i told you how a pawn moves, i told you on first move, the paw can move 2 steps? yeah, well you can't skip a threatened position -
if you try that, the other player may make an "en passant" or "in passing" capture (french word of the day !!!) with the pawn -
although the pawn has passed the capture square of the opposing side, that player can move his or her piece diagonally, as it does in capture, to the square that the other player had skipped -
the pawn that made the double move has been considered captured in passing, and is removed from the chessboard.


promotion is a rule in chess that allows a pawn to be changed into any other piece when it reaches the opponent’s side of the board -
this means that when a pawn reaches the eighth rank (for white) or the first rank (for black) -
the pawn can be promoted to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight -
the new piece replaces the pawn on the same square and can be used immediately -
promotion is a powerful tool that can help players gain an advantage in the endgame -
a pawn cannot be promoted to a pawn -
a pawn cannot be promoted to king -
once the pawn reaches the other end, promotion is mandatory, you cannot refuse promotion.

check is a situation in chess where the king is under attack by one or more of the opponent’s pieces -
when a player’s king is in check, they must make a move to get their king out of check on their next turn -
a king cannot put another king in check, that would be violating the rule "the king cannot put themselves ina threatened position" -
one can escape check by moving the king to a safe square, capturing the attacking piece, or blocking the attack with another piece -
if a player cannot make any legal move to get their king out of check, then it is checkmate and the game is over.

check-mate is when the game end : the king is under threat of capture and cannot escape in one move, or cannot be rescued by an ally -
rescued by an ally means none of the king's pieces can capture the source of the threat.

you have to remember that the king cannot capture a piece if that would put the king in a threatened position.

the king also cannot face off with another king as this is also a threatened position.

fools-mate is the fastest possible checkmate and may also be called 2 move checkmate because checkmate occurs after two moves from the start of the game by black -
don't be the fool, cover your pieces!.

scholar’s mate is a well-known checkmating patterns among chess players, it ends the game after only four moves by attacking the weak f-pawn with a bishop and a queen -
the f7-pawn is considered weak because it is solely defended by the king, and for this reason it is a common target in many opening traps 1 -
it occurs after 1.e4 e5 2.qh5 nc6 3.bc4 nf6?? 4.qxf7#.

resigning or resignation is when a player voluntarily ends the game by conceding defeat to their opponent -
this is usually done when a player feels that they are in an untenable position and that there is no chance of winning or drawing the game.

a draw is the rare condition where neither players can win neither player winning.

a dead position is when neither player has enough material on the board to checkmate their opponent -
this can happen when both players have only their kings left on the board or when one player has only a king and a bishop or a knight while the other player has only a king -
in these situations, it is impossible for either player to checkmate their opponent and the game ends in a draw.

stalemate is when situation in chess where the player whose turn it is to move is not in check and has no legal move -
it is normally the last escape for a player in an inferior position to at least get a draw instead of a defeat -
so if you are leading in pieces and points, plan your checkmate, guide the opponent into a nicely planned checkmate.

recording-moves.
rank is a row of squares on the chessboard -
the chessboard is made up of 8 ranks, numbered 1 to 8 -
rank 1 is the row closest to the white player and rank 8 is the row closest to the black player -
the pieces are initially set up on ranks 1 and 2 for white and ranks 7 and 8 for black -
the ranks are an important part of chess notation as they are used to identify the position of pieces on the board.

chess notation is a system used to record chess moves. the most commonly used notation is algebraic notation -
in algebraic notation, each piece is represented by a letter k for king, q for queen, r for rook, b for bishop, and n for knight; pawns are not represented by a letter -
ending squares of the piece being moved are identified using the coordinate system described earlier, where the file is represented by a letter and the rank is represented by a number -
an example, the move “e4” means that a pawn has been moved to the square e4 -
if a piece is captured, an “x” is placed between the piece being moved and the destination square -
for example: “nxe4” means that a knight has captured a piece on the square e4. special symbols are used to indicate check (“+”) and checkmate (“#”).

fianchetto is a pattern of development wherein a bishop is developed to the second rank of the adjacent "b" or "g" file the knight pawn having been moved one or two squares forward -
it is a staple of many hypermodern openings -
plan is to delay direct occupation of the centre with the plan of undermining and destroying the opponent's occupied centre.

a chessboard is a gameboard used to play chess. it consists of 64 squares, 8 rows by 8 columns, on which the chess pieces are placed -
it is square in shape and uses two colours of squares, one light and one dark, in a chequered pattern -
during play, the board is oriented such that each player's near-right corner square is a light square.

the columns of a chessboard are known as files, the rows are known as ranks -
the lines of adjoining same-coloured squares (each running from one edge of the board to an adjacent edge) are known as diagonals -
each square of the board is named using algebraic, descriptive, or numeric chess notation; algebraic notation is the standard -
in algebraic notation, using white's perspective, files are labeled a through h from left to right, and ranks are labeled 1 through 8 from bottom to top -
each square is identified by the file and rank which it occupies. the a- through d-files comprise the queenside, while the e- through h-files comprise the kingside.

a king, cannot capture a king; it can only protect the piece putting the other king in check.
white always moves first.

who moves first? white always moves first.

Alongside the Queen, Rooks and Bishops are essential to a solid game plan. Rooks, valued at five points each, can move horizontally or vertically across the board.

Bishops, valued at three points each, can move diagonally across the board, controlling the color squares they occupy. Two Bishops, one on each color, are a formidable duo when coordinating attacks and defenses.

Knights hold unique importance due to their distinct L-shaped movement. Valued at three points each, they are the only chess pieces capable of jumping over other pieces when necessary. Moreover, Knights are incredibly valuable in the early stages of the game, as they can quickly be maneuvered into optimal positions.


The Sicilian Defense: Considered the most common response to the King's Pawn Opening, you initiate the Sicilian Defense by responding to 1. e4 with c5. It's easy to build on this defense with a variety of different variations, such as the Najdorf, Dragon, or Classical Variations, among others -
Modern Defense is a Great Opening to Play for a Win with Black.
